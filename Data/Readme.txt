For the programs to work, it is expected that this folder contains three files called
"slow_version.m", "medium_version.m", and "fast_version.m", where "version"
could be either "v4" or "v5".
These files can be found in Caruso et al. repositories, at:
  - Github: "https://github.com/marcocaruso/mimu_optical_dataset_caruso_sassari/releases/tag/v5.0" or
  - IEEEDataPort: "https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/mimuopticalsassaridataset
